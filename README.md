This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge Requirements
You are tasked with developing an prototypical solution for displaying the collected data to our test users inside of a web browser. The objective is to give them an instant overview over the current health and activity of the installed machines.

## Applicaton Workflow
Through this application machine list will be displaying. Sorting and filtering also enabled. Live events according to the machine will be displaying on machine detail page.

## Packages Used
Redux,
Redux-Saga,
Phoenix,
Lodash.
MomentJs,
Search-Query

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### `Redux DevTools`
To run the project in development mode or locally in browser need to have installed Redux DevTools installed. Since it has been configured inside the code, so it is required to have installed on browser otherwise it will throw an error.
